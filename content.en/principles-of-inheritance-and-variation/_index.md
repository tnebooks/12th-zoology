**Learning objectives**

_➢ Learns the inheritance of multiple alleles with reference to human blood groups._

_➢ Understands the mechanism of sex determination in human beings, insects and birds._

_➢ Learns about sex linked (X and Y) inherited diseases in human beings._

_➢ Understands the Mendelian disorders and diseases associated with chromosomal abnormalities._

_➢ Gains knowledge on extra chromosomal inheritance._

_➢ Realises the significance of the applications of genetics in the improvement of human race._


Genetics is a branch of biology that deals with the study of heredity and variations. It describes how characteristics and features pass on from the parents to their offsprings in each successive generation. The unit of heredity is known as the gene. Gene is the inherited factor that determines the biological character of an organism. A variation is the degree by which the progeny differs from their parents.

In this chapter, we are going to learn about multiple alleles with reference to the human blood groups, sex determination in man, insects and birds, sex linked inherited traits, genetic disorders and extra chromosomal inheritance. The betterment of human race can be achieved by methods like eugenics, euthenics and euphenics.
