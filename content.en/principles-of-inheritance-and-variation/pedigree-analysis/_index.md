### Genetic Disorders 

A genetic disorder is a disease or syndrome that is caused by an abnormality in an individual DNA. Abnormalities can range from a small mutation in a single gene to the addition or subtraction of an entire chromosome or even a set of chromosomes. Genetic disorders are of two types namely, Mendelian disorders and chromosomal disorders.
