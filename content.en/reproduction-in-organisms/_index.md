Living organisms show a life cycle involving birth, growth, development,maturation, reproduction and death. Reproduction is the fundamental feature of all living organisms. It is a biological process by which organisms produce their young ones. The young ones grow and mature to repeat the process. Thus reproduction results  in continuation of species and introduces variations in organisms, which are essential for adaptation and evolution of their own kind.
