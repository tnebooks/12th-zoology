Sexual reproduction


Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes to form a diploid  
zygote, which develops into a new organism. It leads to genetic variation. The types of sexual reproduction seen in animals are syngamy (fertilization) and conjugation. In **syngamy,** the fusion of two haploid gametes takes place to produce a diploid zygote. Depending upon the place where the fertilization takes place, it is of two types. In **external fertilization,** the fusion of male and female gametes takes place outside the body of female organisms in the water medium. e.g. sponges, fishes and amphibians. In internal **fertilization,** the fusion of male and female gametes takes place within the body of female organisms. e.g. reptiles, aves and mammals.

**POWER OF REGENERATION**

Sponge when macerated and squeezed through fine silk cloth, the cluster of cells pass through, and these can regenerate new sponges. This technique is used for cultivation of sponges.

Different kinds of syngamy (fertilization) are prevalent among living organisms.

**a) Autogamy**- The male and female gametes are produced by the same cell or same organism and both the gametes fuse together to form a zygote. e.g. _Actinosphaerium_ and _Paramecium_.

**b) Exogamy**- The male and female gametes are produced by different parents and they fuse to form a zygote. So it is biparental. e.g. Human beings – dioecious or unisexual animal.

**c)Hologamy**- Lower organisms, sometimes the entire mature organisms do not form gametes but they themselves behave as gametes and the fusion of such mature individuals is known as **hologamy** e.g. _Trichonympha._

d) **Paedogamy-** It is the sexual union of young individuals produced immediately after the division of the adult parent cell by mitosis. e.g. _Actinophrys._

**e) Merogamy**- The fusion of small sized and morphologically different gametes (merogametes) takes place. e.g. _Protozoa._

**f) Isogamy**- The fusion of morphological and physiological identical gametes (isogametes) is called **isogamy**. e.g. _Monocystis._

**g) Anisogamy**- The fusion of dissimilar gametes is called **anisogamy** (_Gr. An_\-without; iso-equal; _gam_\-marriage). Anisogamy occurs in higher animals but it is customary to use the term fertilization instead of anisogamy or syngamy. e.g. higher invertebrates and all vertebrates.

**Conjugation** is the temporary union of the two individuals of the same species. During their union both individuals, called the conjugants exchange certain amount of nuclear material (DNA) and then get separated. Conjugation is common among ciliates, e.g. _Paramecium, Vorticella_ and bacteria (Prokaryotes).

**Phases of life cycle:** Organisms have three phases – Juvenile phase, reproductive phase and senescent phase. **Juvenile phase/ vegetative phase** is the period of growth between the birth of the individual upto reproductive maturity. During **reproductive phase/ maturity phase** the organisms reproduce and their offsprings reach maturity period. On the basis of time, breeding animals are of two types: **seasonal breeders** and **continuous breeders**. Seasonal breeders reproduce at particular period of the year such as frogs, lizards, most birds, deers etc., Continuous breeders continue to breed throughout their sexual maturity e.g. honey bees, poultry, rabbit etc., **Senescent phase** begins at the end of reproductive phase when degeneration sets in the structure and functioning of the body.  

**PARTHENOGENESIS (_Gr. Parthenos_ – virgin, _Genesis_\- produce)**

Development of an egg into a complete individual without fertilization is known as parthenogenesis. It was first discovered by Charles Bonnet in 1745. Parthenogenesis is of two main types namely, Natural Parthenogenesis and Artificial Parthenogenesis. In certain animals, parthenogenesis occurs regularly, constantly and naturally in their life cycle and is known as **natural parthenogenesis**.

**Natural parthenogenesis are of different types:**

a) Arrhenotoky: In this type only males are produced by parthenogenesis. eg: honey bees b) Thelytoky: In this type only females are produced by parthenogenesis.eg: Solenobia c) Amphitoky: In this type parthenogenetic egg may develop into individuals of any sex. eg: _Aphis_
```

Natural parthenogenesis may be of two types, viz., complete and incomplete. **Complete** **parthenogenesis** is the only form of reproduction in certain animals and there is no biparental sexual reproduction. There are no male organisms and so, such individuals are represented by females only. **Incomplete parthenogenesis** is found in some animals in which both sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis occurs. e.g. In honeybees; fertilized eggs (zygotes) develop into queen and workers, whereas unfertilized eggs develop into drones (male). In **paedogenetic parthenogenesis (paedogenesis)** the larvae produce a new generation of larvae by parthenogenesis. It occurs in the sporocysts and Redia larvae of liver fluke. It is also seen in the larvae of some insects. e.g. Gall fly. In **artificial parthenogenesis**, the unfertilized egg (ovum) is induced to develop into a complete individual by physical or chemical stimuli. e.g., Annelid and seaurchin eggs.

**Summary**

Reproduction is a process by which the living beings propagate or duplicate their own kind. Reproduction can be broadly classified into asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction fusion of gametes are not involved, but in sexual reproduction the formation and fusion of gametes occur. Different modes of asexual reproduction are fission, budding, fragmentation and regeneration. Fission is further divided into binary fission, multiple fission, sporulation and strobilation. According to the plane of fission different kinds of binary fission have been identified in different organisms. They are simple irregular binary fission, transverse binary fission, longitudinal binary fission and oblique binary fission. Multiple fission is the division of the parent into many small daughter cells simultaneously. Budding is another mode of asexual reproduction. The parent body produces one or more buds; each bud grows into a young one and may separate from the parent to lead a normal life. When many buds are formed on the outer surface of the parent, it is known as exogenous budding. Hundreds of buds are formed inside the cytoplasm and remain within the body of the parent, this process is called endogenous budding. Fragmentation is another mode of asexual reproduction. In fragmentation the body of the parent breaks into fragments (pieces). Each fragment has the potential to develop into a new individual. Regeneration is the development of the whole body of an organism from a small fragment. It is of two types namely restorative regeneration and reparative regeneration.

Various modes of sexual reproduction is seen in animals. In syngamy the fusion of two haploid gametes takes place to produce a zygote. The following kinds of syngamy is prevalent among the living organism. They are autogamy, exogamy, hologamy, paedogamy, merogamy, isogamy, anisogamy  
and conjugation. Parthenogenesis is the special type of sexual reproduction seen in animals. It is of two main types namely natural parthenogenesis and artificial parthenogenesis.
