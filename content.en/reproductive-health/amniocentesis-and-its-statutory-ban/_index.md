Amniocentesis and its statutory ban

Due to small family norms and the skewed choice for a male child, female population is decreasing at an alarming rate. Amniocentesis is a prenatal technique used to detect any chromosomal abnormalities in the foetus and it is being often misused to determine the sex of the foetus. Once the sex of the foetus is known, there may be a chance of female foeticide. Hence, a statutory ban on amniocentesis is imposed.
