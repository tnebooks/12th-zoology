Need for reproductive health- Problems and strategies

India is amongst the first few countries in the world to initiate the **‘Family planning programme’** since 1951 and is periodically assessed every decade. These programmes are popularly named as ‘**Reproductive and Child Health Care** (RCH). Major tasks carried out under these programmes are:

-  Creating awareness and providing medical assistance to build a healthy society.

-  Introducing sex education in schools to provide information about adolescence and adolescence related changes.

-  Educating couples and those in the marriageable age groups about the available birth control methods and family planning norms.

-  Creating awareness about care for pregnant women, post-natal care of mother and child and the importance of breast feeding.

-  Encouraging and supporting governmental and non-governmental agencies to identify new methods and/or to improve upon the existing methods of birth control.
