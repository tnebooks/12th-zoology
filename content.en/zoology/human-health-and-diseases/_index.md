The World Health Organization \[WHO\] defines health as ‘a state of complete

physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely absence of diseases’. We can also say “HEALTH IS WEALTH”, when people are healthy they are more efficient at work. Health increases longevity of people and reduces infant and adult mortality. Personal hygiene, regular exercise and balanced diet are very important to maintain good health.

**7.1 Common diseases in human beings**

Disease can be defined as a disorder or malfunction of the mind or body. It involves morphological, physiological and psychological disturbances which may be due to environmental factors or pathogens or genetic anomalies or life style changes. Diseases can be broadly grouped into infectious and non infectious types.

Diseases which are transmitted from one person to another are called infectious diseases or **communicable diseases**. Such disease causing organisms are called **pathogens** and are transmitted through air, water, food, physical contact and vectors. The disease causing pathogen may be virus, bacteria, fungi, protozoan parasites, helminthic parasites, etc., Infectious diseases are common and everyone

suffers from such diseases at some time or the other. Most of the bacterial diseases are curable but all viral diseases are not. Some infectious disease like AIDS may be fatal.

**Non-infectious diseases** are not transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person. In origin they may be genetic (cystic fibrosis), nutritional (vitamin deficiency diseases) and degenerative (arthritis, heart attack, stroke). Among non - infectious diseases, cancer is one of the major causes of death.

**7.1.1 Bacterial and viral diseases Bacterial diseases** Though the number of bacterial species is very high, only a few bacteria are associated with human diseases and are called **pathogenic bacteria**. Such pathogens may emit toxins and affects the body. Common pathogenic bacteria and the bacterial diseases are given in **table 7.1**.

Bacteria spread through air, water or by inhaling the droplets/aerosols or even by sharing utensils, dresses with an infected person. Typhoid fever can be confirmed by **Widal test**.

**Viral diseases** Viruses are the smallest intracellular obligate parasites, which multiply within

**Helminthic diseases** • Ascariasis • Filariasis

**Bacterial resistance** If an antibiotic is used too often to

fight a specific bacterial infection, the bacteria may become resistant to the specific antibiotic. Hence the specific antibiotic can no longer be used to treat the bacterial infection. Some bacteria have developed resistance to many antibiotics. Therefore, infections caused by these bacteria are difficult to be cured.

**Risk of bacterial resistance can be reduced by observing the following steps** • Avoid using antibiotics to treat minor

infections that can be taken care by our immune system.

• Do not use an antibiotic to treat viral infections such as common cold or flu.

• Always follow the prescription. Skipping doses or failing to complete the prescription may allow antibiotic resistance to develop.

living cells. Outside the living cells they cannot carry out the characteristics of a living organism. Viruses invade living cells, forcing the cells to create new viruses. The new viruses break out of the cell, killing it and invade other cells in the body, causing

i. Pneumotropic diseases (respiratory tract infected by influenza)

ii. Dermotropic diseases (skin and subcutaneous tissues affected by chicken pox and measles)

iii. Viscerotropic diseases (blood and visceral organs affected by yellow fever and dengue fever)

iv. Neurotropic diseases (central nervous system affected by rabies and polio). Some common viral diseases of human beings are given in **table 7.2**.

Swine flu was first recognised in the 1919 pandemic and still circulates as a seasonal flu virus. Swine flu is caused by the H1N1

virus strain. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, chills, weakness and body aches. Children, pregnant women and the elderly are at risk from severe infection.

**7.1.2 Protozoan diseases** About 15 genera of protozoans live as parasites within the human body and cause diseases.

**Nipah virus** is a zoonotic virus (transmitted from animals to humans) and also transmitted through contaminated food. In infected people, it causes a range of illness from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis.  

**Amoebiasis** also called amoebic dysentery or amoebic colitis is caused by _Entamoeba histolytica,_ which lives in the human large intestine and feeds on mucus and bacteria **(Fig. 7.1)**. Infective stage of this parasite is the **trophozoite**, which penetrates the walls of the host intestine (colon) and secretes histolytic enzymes causing ulceration, bleeding, abdominal pain and stools with excess mucus. Symptoms of amoebiasis can range from diarrhoea to dysentery with blood and mucus in the stool. House flies (Musca domestica) acts as a carrier for transmitting the parasite from contaminated faeces and water.

**African sleeping sickness** is caused by _Trypanosoma species**.** Trypanosoma_ is generally transmitted by the blood sucking **Tsetse** flies. Three species of _Trypanosoma_ cause sleeping sickness in man. 1. _T. gambiense_ is transmitted by _Glossina_

_palpalis (Tsetse fly) and causes Gambian or_ Central African sleeping sickness **(Fig. 7.2).**

2\. _T. rhodesiense_ is transmitted by _Glossina morsitans_ causing **Rhodesian or East African sleeping sickness.**

3\. _T. cruzi_ is transmitted by a bug called _Triatoma megista_ and causes **Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis.**

**Kala – azar** or visceral leishmaniasis is caused by _Leishmania donovani,_ which is transmitted by the vector _Phlebotomus_ **(sand fly). Infection may occur in the endothelial** cells, bone marrow, liver, lymph glands and

**Malaria is caused by different types of** _Plasmodium_ species such as _P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. falciparum_ **(Table 7.3).** _Plasmodium_ lives in the RBC of human in its mature condition it is called as **trophozoite**. It is transmited from one person to another by the bite of the infected female _Anopheles_ mosquito.

**Life cycle of _Plasmodium_** _Plasmodium vivax_ is a digenic parasite, involving two hosts, man as the secondary host and female _Anopheles_ mosquito as the primary host. The life cycle of Plasmodium involves three phases namely **schizogony, gamogony** and **sporogony (Fig. 7.3)**.

The parasite first enters the human blood stream through the bite of an infected **female _Anopheles_** mosquito. As it feeds, the mosquito injects the saliva containing the sporozoites. The sporozoite within the blood stream immediately enters the hepatic cells of the liver. Further in  

117 Human Health and Diseases

the liver they undergo multiple asexual fission **(schizogony) and produce merozoites. After** being released from liver cells, the merozoites penetrate the RBC’s.

Inside the RBC, the merozoite begins to develop as unicellular trophozoites. The trophozoite grows in size and a central vacuole develops pushing them to one side of cytoplasm and becomes the signet ring stage. The trophozoite nucleus then divides asexually to produce the schizont. The large schizont shows yellowish - brown pigmented granules called **Schuffners granules. The schizont divides** and produces mononucleated merozoites. Eventually the erythrocyte lyses, releasing the merozoites and haemozoin toxin into the blood stream to infect other erythrocytes. Lysis of red blood cells results in cycles of fever and other symptoms. This erythrocytic stage is cyclic and repeats itself approximately every **48 to 72 hours** or longer depending on the species of Plasmodium involved. The sudden release of merozoites triggers an attack on the RBCs. Occasionally, merozoites differentiate into macrogametocytes and **microgametocytes**. When these are ingested by a mosquito, they develop into male and female gametes respectively.

In the mosquito's gut, the infected erythrocytes lyse and male and female gametes fertilize to form a diploid zygote called ookinete. The ookinete migrates to the mosquito's gut wall and develop into an **oocyte**. The oocyte undergoes meiosis by a process called sporogony to form sporozoites. These sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito. The cycle is now completed and when the mosquito bites another human host, the sporozoites are injected and the cycle begins a new.

The pathological changes caused by malaria, affects not only the erythrocytes but also the spleen and other visceral organs. Incubation period of **malaria** is about 12 days. The early symptoms of malaria are headache,




  

118Human Health and Diseases

nausea and muscular pain. The classic symptoms first develop with the synchronized release of merozoites, **haemozoin** toxin and erythrocyte debris into the blood stream resulting in malarial paroxysms – shivering chills, high fever followed by sweating. Fever and chills are caused partly by malarial toxins that induce macrophages to release tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin.

**Table 7.3 Types of malaria**

**Fig. 7.3 Life cy**  

**Prevention** It is possible to break the transmission cycle by killing the insect vector. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in water. Larvae hatch and develop in water but breathe air by moving to the surface. Oil can be sprayed over the water surface, to make it impossible for mosquito larvae and pupae to breathe.

Ponds, drainage ditches and other permanent bodies of water can be stocked

with fishes such as _Gambusia_ which feed on mosquito larvae. Preparations containing _Bacillus thuringiensis_ can be sprayed to kill the mosquito larvae since it is not toxic to other forms of life. The best protection against malaria is to avoid being bitten by mosquito. People are advised to use mosquito nets, wire gauging of windows and doors to prevent mosquito bites.

In the 1950’s the World Health Organisation (WHO) introduced the Malaria eradication programme. This programme was not successful due to the resistance of _Plasmodium_ to the drugs used to treat it and resistance of mosquitoes to DDT and other insecticides.

**Malaria vaccine** is used to prevent malaria. The only approved vaccine as of 2015 is RTS,S(Mosquirix). It

requires four injections and has relatively low efficacy (26–50%). Due to this low efficacy, WHO does not recommend the use of RTS,S vaccine in babies between 6 and 12 weeks of age.

**7.1.3 Fungal diseases** Fungi was recognized as a causative agent of human diseases much earlier than bacteria. Dermatomycosis is a cutaneous infection caused by fungi belonging to the genera _Trichophyton_, _Microsporum_ and _Epidermophyton_.

Ringworm is one of the most common fungal disease in humans **(Fig. 7.4)**. Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on the skin, nails and scalp are the main symptoms of the disease. Heat and moisture help these fungi to grow and makes them to thrive in skin folds such as those in the groin or between  

119 Human Health and Diseases

the toes. Ringworms of the feet is known as **Athlete’s foot** caused by _Tinea pedis_ **(Fig. 7.5)**. Ringworms are generally acquired from soil or by using clothes, towels and comb used by infected persons.

**Fig. 7.4 Symptoms of ringworm**

**Fig. 7.5 Symptoms of Athlete’s foot**

**7.1.4 Helminthic diseases** Helminthes are mostly endoparasitic in the gut and blood of human beings and cause diseases called helminthiasis. The two most prevalent helminthic diseases are Ascariasis and Filariasis.

_Ascaris_ is a monogenic parasite and exhibits sexual dimorphism. **Ascariasis** is a disease caused by the intestinal endoparasite _Ascaris lumbricoides_ commonly called the **round worms (Fig. 7.6)**. It is transmitted through ingestion of embryonated eggs through contaminated food and water. Children playing in contaminated soils are also prone to have a chance of transfer of eggs from hand to mouth. The symptoms of the disease are abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, anaemia, irritability




  

120Human Health and Diseases

and diarrhoea. A heavy infection can cause nutritional deficiency and severe abdominal pain and causes stunted growth in children. It may also cause enteritis, hepatitis and bronchitis.

**Filariasis** is caused by _Wuchereria bancrofti, commonly_ called filarial worm. It is found in the **lymph**

**vessels** and **lymph nodes** of man **(Fig. 7.7)**. _Wuchereria bancrofti is sexually dimorphic,_ viviparous and digenic. The life cycle is completed in two hosts, man and the female _Culex mosquito The female filarial worm gives_ rise to juveniles called microfilariae larvae. In the lymph glands, the juveniles develop into adults. The accumulation of the worms block the lymphatic system resulting in inflammation of the lymph nodes. In some cases, the obstruction of lymph vessels causes elephantiasis or filariasis of the **limbs**, **scrotum** and **mammary glands (Fig. 7.8)**.

**7.2 Maintenance of personal and public hygiene**

**Hygiene** is a set of practices performed to conserve good health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hygiene refers to “conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases." **Personal hygiene** refers to maintaining one’s body clean by bathing, washing hands, trimming fingernails, wearing clean clothes and also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace, including toilets, bathroom facilities, clean and pathogen-free.

Our public places teem with infection, contamination and germs. It seems that every surface we touch and the air we breathe are with pollutants and microbes. It’s not just the public places that are unclean, but we might be amazed at the number of people who do not wash their hands before taking food, after visiting the restroom, or who sneeze without covering their faces. Many infectious diseases such as **typhoid,** **amoebiasis** and **ascariasis** are transmitted through contaminated food and water.

Advancement in science and technology provide effective controlling measures for many infectious and non-infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and adopted immunization programmes have helped to eradicate **small pox** in India. Moreover a large number of infectious diseases like **polio, diphtheria, pneumonia** and **tetanus** have been controlled by the use of vaccines and by creating awareness among the people.

**7.3 Adolescence – drug and alcohol abuse**

Adolescence begins with a period of rapid physical and sexual development called **puberty** to maturity at 12 to 19 years of age. Adolescence is also a highly dynamic period of psychological and social changes in individuals. Adolescents are vulnerable to group (peer) pressure and many youngsters are pushed into experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Proper




  

education and guidance would enable youth to say no to drugs and alcohol and to follow a healthy life style.

Alcohol is a psychoactive drug, which acts on the brain, affecting a person’s mind and behaviour. It is a depressant, which slows down the activity of the nervous system. The intake of certain drugs for a purpose other than their normal clinical use in an amount and frequency that impair one’s physical, physiological and psychological functions is called **drug abuse**.

The drugs which are commonly abused include **opioids, cannabinoids, coca-alkaloids, barbiturates, amphetamines and LSD**.

**Opioids are drugs which bind to specific** opioid receptors present in the **central nervous system** and **intestinal tract**. Heroin (smack) is chemically diacetyl morphine, which is white, odourless and bitter crystalline compound. It is obtained by acetylation of morphine, which is extracted from flowers of the poppy plant **(Fig. 7.9)**. **Morphine** is one of the strongest

pain killer and is used during surgery. It is the most widely abused narcotic drug which acts as a depressant and slows down body functions.

**Cannobinoids** are a group of chemicals obtained from _Cannabis sativa_, the Indian **hemp plant (Fig. 7.10).** Natural cannabinoids are the main source of **marijuana, ganja, hashish** and **charas.** It interferes in the transport of the neurotransmitter, dopamine and has a potent stimulating action on the CNS, producing increased energy and a sense of euphoria.

**Fig. 7.10 _Cannabis sativa_ (Hemp plant)**

**Cocaine** is a white powder that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant, _Erythroxylum coca_. It is commonly called coke or crack. Cocaine causes serious physical and psychological problems including **hallucinations** and **paranoia. The other plants with hallucinogenic** properties are _Atropa belladonna_ and _Datura_ **(Fig. 7.11 and Fig. 7.12)_._**

Drugs like **methamphetamine, amphetamines, barbiturates, tranquilizers,** **Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)** are normally used as medicine to treat patients with mental illness like **depression** and **insomnia** and are often abused.

Tobacco is smoked, chewed and used as snuff. It increases the carbon monoxide content of blood and reduces the concentration of haem bound oxygen, thus causing oxygen deficiency in the body. Tobacco contains **nicotine, carbon monoxide** and **tars,** which cause problems in the heart, lung and nervous system. Adrenal glands are stimulated by nicotine to release adrenaline and nor adrenaline which increases blood pressure and heart beat.

**7.3.1 Addiction and dependence** Addiction is a physical or psychological

need to do or take or use certain substance such as alcohol, to the point where it could be harmful to the individual. This addictive behaviour can be personally destructive to a person. Overtime addicts start to lose not only their jobs, homes and money, but also friendship, family relationships and contact with the normal world. Addiction to drugs and alcohol can lead to a psychological attachment to certain effects such as **euphoria** and temporary feeling of well being.

Repeated use of drugs and alcohol may affect the tolerance level of the receptors present in the body. These receptors then  

respond only to highest doses of drugs and alcohol leading to greater intake and addiction. Excessive use of drug and alcohol leads to physical and psychological dependence. When psychological dependence develops, the drug user gets mentally **‘hooked on’** to the drug. The drug user constantly thinks only about the drug and has continuous uncontrollable craving for it. This state called “**euphoria**” is characterized by mental and emotional preoccupation with the drug.

The use of alcohol during adolescence may have long-term effects. Alcohol interferes with the ability of the liver to break down fat. Over time fat accumulation and high levels of alcohol destroy the liver cells and a scar tissue grows in the place of dead cells. This scarring of the liver is called **“Liver cirrhosis**”. Alcohol irritates the stomach lining due to the production of excess acid leading to ulcers. Excessive alcohol use weakens the heart muscle, causing scar tissue to build up in the cardiac muscle fibers. As a result, heavy drinkers have an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke, coronary artery disease and heart attack. Korsakoff syndrome, a chronic memory disorder is most commonly caused by alcohol misuse.
